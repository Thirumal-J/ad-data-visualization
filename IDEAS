BAR CHART

spends, conversions, revenue - plotted against LABEL

SELECT label, sum(spends), sum(attributed_conversions), sum(attributed_revenue) from campaign_data GROUP by label HAVING sum(spends) IS NOT NULL ORDER BY label ASC;
 
BEST ANSWER -  SELECT label, sum(spends), sum(attributed_conversions), sum(attributed_revenue) from campaign_data GROUP by label ORDER BY label ASC;
